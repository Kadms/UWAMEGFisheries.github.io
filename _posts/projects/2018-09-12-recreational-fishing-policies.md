Whilst recreational fishing policies are designed to meet biological based management objectives, fishers preferences are also incorporated into these decisions. At present there is a lack of transparency about how these preferences are measured and accounted for. This study will test the use of an economic technique known as choice experiments to measure fishers' preferences for suites of management interventions including bag limits, seasonal closures and size limits and attempt to combine these preferences with biological based management strategy evaluations to generate recommendations for policy interventions.

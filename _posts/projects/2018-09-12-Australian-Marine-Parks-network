## Topic 
In 2019 44 new marine parks were implemented in offshore commonwealth waters around Australia as part of the Australian Marine Parks network. At present little is known about how boat based fishers and non-fishing recreators are using these areas. This project will analyse existing data and collect new data on spatial usage patterns at boat ramps adjacent to 13 of these new marine parks. These usage patterns will form baselines in Parks Australia's social and economic monitoring program and inform the planned 10 year review of the marine parks zoning.

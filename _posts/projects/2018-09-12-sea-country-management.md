## Topic
Indigenous Australians have a profound connection to nature and a cultural obligation to take care of Country. As a result, Indigenous people have been sustainably managing their marine estates for millennia. There is an increasing interest in documenting and embedding traditional knowledge into marine management and monitoring yet little work has been done in developing methods and protocols to achieve these goals. This project will build upon participatory mapping methods to document knowledge of senior knowledge holders to help inform marine park and fisheries management in Western Australia.

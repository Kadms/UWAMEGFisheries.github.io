It is essential for Marine Park and Marine Reserves policy development, impacting both commercial and recreational fisheries, to consider the broader socio-economic impacts and cost-benefits of imlementation. We have active research programs consulting key stakeholders to investigate the optimal way that both commercial and recreational fisheries can be spatially managed to meet their objectives and maximise the broader benefits of healthy marine ecosystems to society.
